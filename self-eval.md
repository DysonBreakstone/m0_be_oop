# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

## Answers

- There were certainly a couple of challenges! This assignment took me longer than I thought it would, but figuring out those challenges was immensely satisfying.

- I think the workflow is going pretty well! I have a fairly predictable cycle of feeling good, then feeling stressed about time, then feeling okay, then feeling frustrated at some technical hangup, then feeling great once I've figured it out. I think if I can learn to reduce the stress portion I'll be doing great. 

- Next week? I thought we had the next few weeks off! That said, I think I'm going to put a little more effort into the infrastructure of my days. I've been a little thrown off this week by travel and sickness but I really want to get into a good routine of excercise, work, and productive personal time.
